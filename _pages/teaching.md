A. Machine learning surrogate models for fast computational analyses
------
We developed a series of machine learning and deep learning approaches for surrogate modeling in cardiovascular simulations, these data-driven approaches can lead to fundamental improvements in computational efficiency, i.e., obtain accurate simulation results in real-time.

B. Inverse identification of *in vivo* hyperleastic properties of the aortic wall from clinical images
------
We developed inverse methods to identify anisotropic hyperelastic material properties of the aortic wall from clinical images. The overall goal was to increase the computational efficiency towards clinical applications by employing novel inverse identification strategies. These inverse identification methods can facilitate personalized computational modeling for the diagnosis and treatment of cardiovascular diseases.

C. Learning soft tissue constitutive behaviors via deep neural networks
------
We established deep neural networks as an alternative to model constitutive behaviors of soft tissues. These deep neural network models incorporate physical or microstructural knowledge of soft tissues and have led to performance improvements that could not be achieved by classical constitutive models.

D. Anisotropic failure criterion and probabilistic failure metric of the aortic wall
------
We developed a fiber-based failure criterion and a probabilistic and anisotropic failure index for aortic tissues. The new failure criterion was specifically proposed to capture the ansiotropy of the failure properties. Since the wall strengths can only be accurately obtained using destructive and invasive means, we developed a probabilistic failure metric to incorporate the uncertainties of the wall strength distributions. These novel failure models can be used for noninvasive risk assessment of thoracic aortic aneurysms.

F. Micro-systems for health-related applications
------

F1. A miniature airborne particulate matter sensor based on 3D printed virtual impactor and quartz crystal microbalance (QCM).
* We designed and fabricated a miniature system for detection of airborne particulate matter (PM). To classify airborne particles according to their size, a virtual impactor is fabricated using 3D printing technology. A QCM resonant sensor is utilized to detect the mass of the separated particles. Experiments proved that the miniature system can montior PM concentrations in real-time.

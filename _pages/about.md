I am currently working as a Postdoctoral Fellow at the Wallace H. Coulter Department of Biomedical Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology and Emory University. I received a Ph.D. degree in Mechanical Engineering from Georgia Institute of Technology, in 2020. Previously, I received a B.Eng. degree in Mechatronic Engineering from Zhejiang University, in 2015.

My research interests include:
* Machine learning applications in biomechanics.
* Identification of constitutive parameters by solving inverse problems.
* Computational patient-specific cardiovascular modeling.
* Experimental characterization and constitutive modeling of cardiovascular tissues.
* Uncertainty quantification in computational biomechanics

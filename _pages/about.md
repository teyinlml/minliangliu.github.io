I am currently working as a Postdoctoral Fellow at the [Wallace H. Coulter Department of Biomedical Engineering](https://bme.gatech.edu/bme/), Georgia Institute of Technology and Emory University. I received my Ph.D. degree in Mechanical Engineering from [Georgia Institute of Technology](https://www.gatech.edu/), in 2020. Previously, I received a B.Eng. degree in Mechatronic Engineering from [Zhejiang University](https://www.zju.edu.cn/english/), in 2015.

My research interests lie primarily in the area of constitutive modeling for soft fibrous tissues:
* Machine learning surrogate models for fast computational analysis;
* Patient-specific modeling of arterial growth and remodeling;
* Physics-informed machine learning for constitutive modeling and personalized computation;
* Inverse identification of in vivo constitutive parameters from clinical images;
* Patient-specific computational modeling of cardiovascular interventions;
* Experimental characterization and modeling of the mechanical behavior of cardiovascular tissues.

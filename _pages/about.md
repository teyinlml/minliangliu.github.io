I am currently working as a Postdoctoral Fellow at the [Wallace H. Coulter Department of Biomedical Engineering](https://bme.gatech.edu/bme/), Georgia Institute of Technology and Emory University (advisor: [Dr. Rudolph L. Gleason](https://www.me.gatech.edu/faculty/gleason)). I received my Ph.D. degree in Mechanical Engineering from [Georgia Institute of Technology](https://www.gatech.edu/) (advisor: [Dr. Wei Sun](https://petitinstitute.gatech.edu/wei-sun)), in 2020. Previously, I received a B.Eng. degree in Mechatronic Engineering from [Zhejiang University](https://www.zju.edu.cn/english/), in 2015.

My research interests lie primarily at the intersection of cardiovascular biomechanics, computational modeling, and machine learning. I am working alongside cardiothoracic surgeons, biomechanical engineers, and computer scientists to develop noninvasive personalized computational tools for assisting the clinical prognosis and treatment of cardiovascular diseases. In particular, my work has been focused on the following areas:
* Leveraging the power of machine learning to strategically address challenges in biomechanical modeling:
  * Deep learning surrogate models for fast computational analyses;
  * Physics-informed machine learning for constitutive modeling and personalized computation;
  * Reinforcement learning framework for determination of arterial growth evolution laws;
* Experimental characterization and modeling of the mechanical behavior of cardiovascular tissues;
* Inverse identification of *in vivo* nonlinear anisotropic constitutive parameters from clinical images;
* Patient-specific computational modeling of cardiovascular interventions.
